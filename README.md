# AngularDarkModeTest 🌙

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.3.

# Goals / Outcomes ✨

- Using state
- Leveraging existing dependencies

&nbsp;

# Pre-requisites ✅

- Do not add additional dependencies

&nbsp;

# Requirements 📖

- Add dark-mode switching functionality to the _existing_ dark-mode button
  - Utilise the _existing_ dark-mode scss file by adding `bg-dark` and `text-light` classes to the `app-body` element
- When in Dark mode:
  - The button icon should be `fa-sun`
  - The button icon colour should be `(#FFA500)`
- Add bootstrap column classes to the two paragraphs to get them to sit side by side
- Add bootstrap classes to the button and form fields to style them appropriately
- Add functionality to store the contents of the form field and display an alert when the form is submitted
- Add functionality to clear the form fields when `Reset` is clicked

&nbsp;

# Think about 💡

- How we would use Dark mode on other potential routes/components in a bigger application. Would your solution work for this?
- The best way to handle form state

&nbsp;

# What's Already Been Done 🏁

- Basic app UI
- Dark mode and light mode styles/themes
